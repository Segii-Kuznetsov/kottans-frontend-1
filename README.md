## 0.Git and GitHub
I have never worked with Git before so these courses helped me to dive into a new topic easily. Thanks to [UDACITY](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123) I have learned Git basics and thanks to the game [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk) I could clearly understand how different Git commands work. I am about to start working with Git so this new knowledge is very useful.
